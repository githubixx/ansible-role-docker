role-docker
===========

Installs Docker from official Docker binaries archive. For managing Docker daemon systemd is used. Targeting mainly Ubuntu 16.04 but should work with other Linux OS using systemd. This Ansible playbook is used in [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible (at Scaleway) - Part 6 - Control plane](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-at-scaleway-part-6/) and [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible (at Scaleway) - Part 7 - Worker](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-at-scaleway-part-7/).

Requirements
------------

Since this role is targeting Ubuntu 16.04 a recent kernel should be used (at time of writing it was kernel 4.10.x on my VPS instance). It makes sense to use a recent kernel for Docker in general. Ubuntu 16.04 additionally provides kernel 4.4.x and 4.8.x. I recommend to use >= 4.8.x if possible. Verify that you have `overlayfs` filesystem available (execute `cat /proc/filesystems | grep overlay`. If you see an output you should be fine) on your controller and worker instances. In my case `overlayfs` is compiled into the kernel. If it's not compiled in you can normally load it via `modprobe -v overlay` (`-v` gives us a little bit more information). We'll configure Docker to use overlayfs by default because it's one of the best choises (Docker 1.13.x started to use overlayfs by default if available). But you can change the storage driver via the `docker_storage_driver` variable if you like.

The default variables of the role variables are configured to work with Kubernetes and Flannel overlay network. If you want to use this role without Kubernetes you may want to adjust a few settings (especially `docker_iptables`, `docker_ip-masq`, `docker_bip` and `docker_mtu`). We disable most parts of Docker networking as we leave this up to Flannel.
